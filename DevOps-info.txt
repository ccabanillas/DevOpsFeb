My learning goals
- Create a code project in GitHub that will be auto deployed via CI/CD
- Create local dev env in Linux to make code changes
- Run Jenkins on Linux for continuous integration
- Need to decide what to include in testing phase for things such as unit tests and code linting
- Project deployment will be on Linux but to decide what that will involve, for example Docker

DevOps feedback I received (context was what's needed to be a DevOps engineer and best tools to learn)
- To start with need to know shell commands, git commands, Docker
- Tools to learn: Jenkins, Rancher, harness, spinnaker, prometheus, grafana, ELK stack. Having basic knowledge in python helps a lot
- Chef and Puppet are older tools but still in wide use
- Travis CI and CircleCI are some others used for CI/CD automation
- Infrastructure as Code is becoming more important. Terraform is leading along with Azure templates and cloud formation templates (AWS). Along with it is Helm Charts as an add-on.

Some YouTube videos I've found useful

-- this was useful for getting VirtualBox and Linux setup

-- still going through this one but covers a variety of DevOps aspects
